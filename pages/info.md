The idea behind starting my Blog is to share my experience acquired while
working in the computer science and to share my ideas in my greatest hobby:
the card game bridge. And of course to talk about the countries I have lived
in: the Netherlands and France.

It may involve technical issues but also non-technical things like my working
experience or the bridge community.

Actually, I have been long wanting to have a personal Blog site. As there are
people who love to talk, I am merely a writer. It helps me to organize my
thoughts and it may help or amuse others, :). And, as a matter of fact I am a
big fan of open standards and exchanging knowledge and ideas.

In the beginning of this year (2019) I proposed to my employer Sogeti to
publish my experience gathered in the testing environment. I was working for a
client at that time and I had done some thorough research related to automated
testing with Java, Cucumber and Selenium. Really interesting stuff and the
client was very happy with it but after a month of silence my career change
manager (actually my career manager, but I changed my career thanks to him)
told me I could publish something in the private Sogeti domain. Not actually
the answer I wanted so when a very interesting opportunity came up to change
my career, I took it with both hands.

And the pause between the two employers gave me the time to finally start my
Blog site.
