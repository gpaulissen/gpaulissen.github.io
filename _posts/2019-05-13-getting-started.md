In the beginning ... you decide to start a Blog site. How?

<!--more-->

Well, I love open source and I love to be able to write documents in a fairly
simple way, without a special editor. Just Vi or Emacs should do the trick. So
the [Markdown language](https://www.markdowntutorial.com) seemed to be a
logical choice.

And of course as a coder I want to store the Blog articles in a source
code repository. The standard nowadays is [GitHub](https://www.github.com). And it
appears that [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is the website for you
and your projects.

And when the choice is GitHub Pages you want to use
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. And then you need a
Jekyll theme. Well, in the end I found
[Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes) a suitable (remote) theme.

For getting into contact with me, I used [Basin](https://usebasin.com/).

So this is the list of components I use to store and publish my Blogs:
* GitHub Pages - publish your website hosted directly from your GitHub repository
* Jekyll - the tool for Blogging using Markdown syntax
* Minimal Mistakes - a Jekyll theme
* Basin - a secure form backend
